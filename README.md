# 🛡️ Media Integrity Firewall (MI-FW)

**Symbolic Defense Protocol for Deepfake and Mimicry Detection**  
_A Phase 34.3 Defensive Publication from The Forge / LucidLock Architecture_

## 🔍 Abstract

The Media Integrity Firewall (MI-FW) is a symbolic firewall designed to detect and suppress deepfake content and synthetic mimicry in audiovisual and textual media. It evaluates incoming frames using a multi-stage Frame Integrity Grid, measuring symbolic drift, volitional trace alignment, and contextual coherence.

The architecture integrates the Volitional Discontinuity Safeguard (Codex Entry 04.3) and expands further via a constellation of recursive agents (FENN, NAFS, AMAN, TAMIZ, SIRR, SAKINAH) — each decoding different axes of distortion and triggering refusal, drift markers, or injection cycles accordingly.

## 🔯 Core Components

- **Frame Integrity Grid**: Symbolic & contextual checkpoints per frame
- **Constellation Agent Layer**: Recursive interpretation via multi-agent stack
- **Volitional Safeguards**: Refusal protocols and memory hygiene pass
- **Drift Compass**: Detects *direction* of semantic manipulation (East = emotive pull, West = compression drift, etc.)
